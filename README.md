   Onions,1.25
   ```

   **Stock CSV** (`input_stock.csv`):
   ```csv
   Ingredient,Received Qty
   Tomatoes,150.0
   Onions,80.0
   ```

   **Usage CSV** (`usage.csv`):
   ```csv
   Ingredient,Used Qty
   Tomatoes,120.0
   Onions,65.0
   ```

   **Waste CSV** (`waste.csv`):
   ```csv
   Ingredient,Wasted Qty
   Tomatoes,8.0
   Onions,3.0
   ```

3. **Upload Files**: Use the file uploaders in the web interface to upload all four CSV files

4. **Generate Report**: Click "Run Report" to process your data

5. **View Results**: Review the calculated metrics including:
   - Total used cost
   - Total waste cost
   - Total shrinkage cost
   - Grand total cost

6. **Analyze Results**: 
   - Review summary metrics with percentage insights
   - Use filtering options to focus on problem areas
   - Sort data by different criteria for analysis
   - Pay attention to automated insights and warnings

7. **Export Reports**: Download professional PDF or Excel reports with detailed formatting

## Authentication

The application includes a secure authentication system:

### Demo Accounts
- **Admin**: Username `admin`, Password `admin123`
- **Manager**: Username `manager`, Password `manager456`
- **Staff**: Username `staff`, Password `staff789`

### Security Features
- Password hashing using SHA256

## Sample Data

The repository includes comprehensive sample CSV files for testing:
- `sample_ingredient_info.csv` - 15 common restaurant ingredients with realistic unit costs
- `sample_input_stock.csv` - Sample received quantities 
- `sample_usage.csv` - Realistic usage patterns
- `sample_waste.csv` - Waste data showing common loss patterns

These files demonstrate typical restaurant scenarios including items with high waste, shrinkage issues, and normal usage patterns.

## Calculations & Insights

### Core Calculations
- **Expected Use** = Used Quantity + Wasted Quantity
- **Used Cost** = Used Quantity Ã— Unit Cost
- **Waste Cost** = Wasted Quantity Ã— Unit Cost
- **Expected Use Cost** = Expected Use Ã— Unit Cost
- **Stocked Cost** = Stocked Quantity Ã— Unit Cost
- **Shrinkage Cost** = Stocked Cost - Expected Use Cost (dollar value of missing/stolen inventory)
- **Total Cost** = Used Cost + Waste Cost + Shrinkage Cost

### Advanced Analytics
- **Waste Percentage** = (Total Waste Cost Ã· Grand Total Cost) Ã— 100
- **Shrinkage Percentage** = (Total Shrinkage Cost Ã· Grand Total Cost) Ã— 100
- **Automated Insights** = Warnings when waste or shrinkage exceed 5% of total costs
